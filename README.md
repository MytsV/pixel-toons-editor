<h3>Completeness</h3>

Unfortunately, due to personal reasons I couldn't work a lot on the coursework, so it is not fully finished and polished. However, all the core features are here.

<h3>Technologies</h3>

The project is using modular JS on the frontend with Web API. There are no other external libraries used.  For deployment, it will be assembled into a single file and compiled with Babel. 

<h3>Tests</h3>

There are unit-test created with the <b>Mocha</b> framework.

<h3>Cooperation</h3>

Our group CodeUmoja has planned to merge projects together, hence the fork. We prepared the configuration and main files together.

I have also received and made peer reviews ([1](https://github.com/MrSampy/Map-Gen-2D/issues/2), [2](https://github.com/jinworldwildhandsome/graphic_calculator/issues/1), [3](https://github.com/Dimdim28/Tanks.js/issues/2))
