# Platform for creating and sharing pixelated animations <br>

The project is using modular JS on the frontend. For deployment, it will be assembled into a single file.
Moreover, there are unit-test created with the <b>Mocha</b> framework.

User interface is currently extremely raw. It will be improved in the future.
